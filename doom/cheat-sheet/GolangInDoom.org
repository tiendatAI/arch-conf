#+TITLE: Golang in Doom Emacs
* Config
- Don't forget to uncomment =go= in =init.el=
  - Enable =lsp= under =:tools= and change =go= to =(go +lsp)= if you're planning to use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][Language Protocol Server]] using [[http://emacs-lsp.github.io/][lsp-mode]].
  - Enable =syntax= under =:checkers= if you're planning to use golangci-lint as your linter via flycheck. I recommend that you set golangci-lint as the next flychecker after LSP.
  - Enable =(web +html)= under =:lang=, this will install [[https://web-mode.org/][web-mode]]. To use it for your Go templates, first enable web mode =web-mode=, then do =M-x web-mode-set-engine= and choose go.
  - Enable =(format +onsave)= under =:editor= to run =gofmt= on each save
* First Steps
- Run =doom doctor= and look inside the =:lang go= section to see what executables you lack and install them.
* Basics
- First see LSP part of the main file and figure out how they are used in go-mode. For example:
  - Running =go run file.go= corresponds to =SPC c e=
  - Running =go fmt file.go= corresponds to =SPC c f=
- =C-c C-g= or =M-x gorepl-run= to open a go repl on top of [[https://github.com/x-motemen/gore][gore]].
- =C-c C-e= or =M-x gorepl-eval-region= to evaluate the selected region.
* Tests & Benchmarks
- =SPC m t a= to run all existing tests
- =SPC m t b a= to run all existing benchmarks
- =SPC m t G= to write tests for all functions using gotests
- =SPC m t g= to write tests for selected functions using gotests
* Go Playground
- =M-x= (or equivalently) =SPC := with:
  - =go-play-buffer= to send selected buffer to the Playground
  - =go-play-region= to send selected region to the Playground
  - =go-download-play= to download from the Playground
