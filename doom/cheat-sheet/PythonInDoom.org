#+TITLE: Python in Doom Emacs
* Config
- Don't forget to uncomment =python= in =init.el=
  - Change enable =lsp= under =:tools= and change =python= to =(python +lsp)= if you're planning to use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][Language Protocol Server]] using [[http://emacs-lsp.github.io/][lsp-mode]].
  - Enable =(company +childframe)= under =:complection= as well.
* First Steps
- Run =doom doctor= and look inside the python section to see what executables you lack and install them.
* Basics
- First see the LSP section of the main file
- =M-x run-python= to open a python shell.
  - =python-shell-send-region= or =C-c C-r= to send a selected region to the shell.
  - =python-shell-send-file= or =C-c C-l= to send another file to the shell.
  - =python-shell-send-buffer= or =C-c C-c= to send a selected region to the shell.
* Virtual Environments
** General
- Once a virtual environment is activated, =vterm= will open a terminal with that certain environment activated.
** [[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/][Virtualenv]] or [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html][Venv]]
- =pyvenv-workon= to activate a virtualenv defined in =~/.virtualenvs=.
  - Install virtualenv using =pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv=
  - After opening a python file, =pyvenv-create= to create a venv.
- =pyvenv-activate= to activate a venv from a certain path.
  - Use =python -m venv PATH= to create a venv in a directory.
- =pyvenv-deactivate= to deactivate a venv or a virtualenv.
** TODO [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][Pyenv]]
